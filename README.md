## **Story Pitch**:
<br>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a serious issue since its emergence in 2019. The pandemic has affected millions of people over the years. A number of researchers are continuing their studies in order to solve the issues that come up with the pandemic. For our study, our main topic of the project will be about determining if there is a correlation between the mortality rate of COVID-19 and the weather temperature.</p>



<p>The strong, central, unifying theme is a yearning to understand COVID-19 as a result of the loss of life, income, and stability that it has caused. There have been several research papers that have been done on this topic, but there are no solid conclusions on it yet. The topic of our final project deals with the fundamental issues in our world, as millions of lives have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an opportunity for us to offer intelligent insight because we would talk about how temperature could have an impact on people infected with the virus and this is not a question that can be simply answered with common sense. There are still scientific debates on whether temperature does have an impact on the mortality rate so this project will give new insights that arenâ€™t obvious.</p>
    
<p>The elements of drama with this arise from people who think COVID-19 is over, and people at risk of death from the virus. Many people think that viruses are vulnerable to heat. However, COVID-19 seemed to contradict this belief as infection of COVID-19 did not decrease during the summer. Taking a look at the data we found to see if there is a correlation will provide more information on mortality. Overall, the story we would tell is about how the weather temperature affects and correlates with the mortality rates of COVID-19. Even though there is a chance that the correlation is not statistically significant, it will still provide an interesting story contradicting one of the researches made.</p>

## **Final Datasets We Will Use:**<br>
**1.(NOAA) Average Temperature of US States by Month**<br>
Link:https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/statewide/time-series/1/tavg/all/1/2021-2022?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000<br>
- The data is collected by NOAA(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). NOAA stored the average temperature for each month for all 50 states in the US.
- There are data for the average temperature for each month for all 50 states for year 2021
- We selected certain states for our data.There are going to be 180 rows and 7 columns.<br>

**2.(CDC) United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time - ARCHIVED**<br>
Link:https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36<br>
- There are 60,061 rows and 15 columns 
- Data is collected by CDC(Center for Disease Control)
- Health departments report the cases of confired cases,deaths to CDC and try to reprot the most accurate and up to date data possible. There are possibilities that not all cases of COVID-19 is reported but by far data is very accurate 
- Deaths are regularly reported to the National VItal Statiustics system to get provisioned on accuracy.<br>



## **Background Research:**<br>

**Effects of Weather on Covid-19**<br>
Link:https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/15/5399<br>
- This research paper gave us the initial interest about the topic. The research paper conducted a global scale research of finding out if the spread of
COVID-19 was affected by temperature and humidity. 
- We decided to focus our project on just temperature because we thought the effect of temperature would be greater than just humidity alone.

**Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count (NY Times)**<br>
Link:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html<br>
- This page gave us an idea about how we want to present our information as there were data, graphs, and interactive maps.
- An interactive map would be an interesting way to represent the data we are going to look at.

**Global to USA County Scale Analysis of Weather, Urban Density, Mobility, Homestay, and Mask Use on COVID-19(University of Texas,Austin, research results)**<br>
Link:https://news.utexas.edu/2020/11/02/hot-or-cold-weather-alone-has-no-significant-effect-on-covid-19-spread/ (news article)<br>
https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/21/7847 <br>
- This is another research paper that we thought was interesting. Their study compared different factors that could affect the spread of COVID-19, including weather, mask use, and urban density. <br>
- We decided to see if there is a correlation between the spread and mortality of COVID-19 since most research deals with the spread of COVID-19 rather than the mortality rate.<br>

**Medical News Today: How does Weather Affect Covid-19**<br>
Link:https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-does-weather-affect-covid-19#Hours-of-sunshine-and-UV-light- <br>
- This article furthered our understanding of how weather and viruses relate. Also, the article takes UV light into account which we found to be interesting.
- The article talks about how hard it is to correlate the temperature with COVID-19 infection as there are many other factors that could contribute to the infection. 

**Harvard Article on Coronavirus and climate change**<br>
Link:https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/coronavirus-and-climate-change/ <br>
- This article provided a vast amount of information on our topic. It talks about the possibility of climate change, contact made between animals due to weather temperature, and air pollution that could lead to a possible increase in infection rate. 
- An additional topic shown that connects to our project that piqued our interest was the effect of pollution, but we decided not to do it as we thought correlation from temperature was more interesting.
